	<p>Arguably the deadliest creature on the Island, Tyrannosaurus dominum is a killing machine. Active mostly when hunting for food or defending its nest, a good plan is to avoid every Tyrannosaurus. It is pure power -- from its stomp to its tail. It is not able to intimidate every foe with its roar, but upon hearing it, it might scare the poop out of you - quite literally. Despite being a different sub-species of Tyrannosaurus, everyone I've met still refers to them as a "Rex" or a "T-Rex". I've long since stopped trying to convince anyone, especially the few who I've encountered wearing Tyrannosaurus teeth as necklaces.</p>

	<p>Like the Carnotaurus, Baryonyx aquafulguar is a large carnivore, but not large enough to rival the Island's apex predators. While not as powerful as some deep-sea predators or Spinosaurus, Baryonyx is an extremely fast swimmer who is still sufficiently nimble enough to threaten most creatures on the Island. And yet despite being a fast, dangerous dinosaur, Baryonyx almost exclusively consumes fish and other water-dwellers. The highly specific metabolism of Baryonyx seems to allow it to heal wounds almost preternaturally fast after feeding on nutritious fish meat. Perhaps this is why Baryonyx rarely attacks land animals?</p>
